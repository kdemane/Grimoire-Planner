- start game
- answer 2, 2, 3 for bonus AP 1
- don't do a goddamn thing with Luso for the first fight, just stand around
- after this, you will be level 1 with 60 XP
- pick a guy who's level 3 or lower, and keep him on the side for the first round "real" crew
- only do plot figthts, until you are done with the one with the tomato stalk
- at this point, Luso should be level 3, and someone else should be level 2 or 3 that you kept around. Kick everyone else
  out of the clan
- walk back and forth between Baptiste Hill and Targ Wood for about 7 hours filling out the clan with 28 more level 3 humes,
  only get the classes that you will actually use (I'm doing soldier/thief/black mage, shelving archer/white mage because
  their stats are bad)
- grind out pub quests/overland encounters with 6 random disposable fools until Luso + 5 other guys (the first "real" party
  have mastered the 2 or 3 jobs they are going to actually use until ~level 30
- YOU CAN UNLOCK NINJA AND JUGGLER AT THIS POINT, BEFORE YOU GET ADELLE, AT AVERAGE PARTY LEVEL 3. Not sure about other
  good leveling classes for other races, have to look into that, but w/e, Luso is hooked up
- I'm actually mastering every fuckin thing available basically for Luso/other non-hume/4 other humes at this point.. it's
  not all that much stuff.. seem to have all the loot and I have 4 soldier/4 thief/3 archer/2 hunter/2 paladin, starting
  black mage/white mage.. that's.. about it..
- kick out all of the guys who have been leveling up, recruit 6 more level 3 fools
- do the next plot quest, get Adelle (who should theoretically be level 3 as long as non-lvl 3 levels are 29 or lower)
- powermow the plot on-level or below-level until you get all the NPC's. If you need to level up + boot/replace another 6
  man crew, fine, but you need to hold on to as many level 3 dudes as you can
- once average clan level is 30, recruit the final crew and bust it out.. theoretically, after they have mastered their
  jobs, boot all the level 3 "marshemellows" and do shit on-level with the hardcore  crew
